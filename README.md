# HTML-CSS-Basics
My progression of learning HTML and CSS

Recently i was set a project to make a website, this website didnt have to look overly amazing just fit the clients requirements (my teacher) so i decided to use Wix and thought it was really easy but tedious at the same time. So as a challenge i thought it would be a good idea to learn HTML and CSS to see how long it would take me to reach the same level of quality like using Wix. I won't be learning JavaScript yet as that will come in later.
