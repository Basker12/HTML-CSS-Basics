# HTML-CSS-Basics
My progression of learning HTML and CSS

Recently i was set a project to make a website, this website didnt have to look overly amazing just fit the clients requirements (my teacher) so i decided to use Wix and thought it was really easy but tedious at the same time. So as a challenge i thought it would be a good idea to learn HTML and CSS to see how long it would take me to reach the same level of quality like using Wix. I won't be learning JavaScript yet as that will come in later.

So far i've learnt quite a bit, i know how to put in images how to style them in CSS and put a link under the image to allow the user to download it. I added another page with just an image to test it out. Im not gonna list everything i know so far but check out the index.html file in the repo for the whole code. Of course the website looks like a 5yr old as made it but im gonna improve it too look a lot better.

Things i want to do:
- I have read the basics of the w3Schools html guide and might start the CSS basics guide now
- 

Im considering to make a new website from scratch and make it look good and make it functional
